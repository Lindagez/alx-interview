This script prints all characters of a Star Wars movie. The first positional argument passed is the Movie ID - example: 3 = “Return of the Jedi”.

To use the script, first install the requests module with pip:

pip install requests

Then, run the script with the movie ID as the argument:

python 0-starwars_characters.py 3

This will print all characters from the Return of the Jedi movie to the console.

The script uses the Star Wars API to get the list of characters for the movie. The characters are then printed to the console, one per line.

This script is useful for getting a list of all characters in a Star Wars movie. It can be used for research, for creating fan art, or for any other purpose that requires a list of characters.
